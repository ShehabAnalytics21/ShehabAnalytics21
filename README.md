### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I'm a Medical Scientist, Business Analyst and Financial Analyst.

- In science, I've used processing to produce visually appealing representations of experimental data. 
  I used R to produce statistical reports using graphical and numerical illustrations.
  I used MATLAB to solve mathematical equations (Specifically Linear Algebra), statistically analyse data, and optimise process variables.
 
- In Business Analytics, I used SQL to create reports that would comply with RBA's rules & regulations.  
  I used Python (Through Jupyter Notebook) to perform data cleaning, in-depth EDA, and predictive analysis. 
 
- In Finance, I used Python (Through Jupyter Notebook) to create a variety of financial models such as GARCH, ARCH, CAPM, and ARMA.
  I also used Python to perform financial stress, tail risk, and accuracy measurements, and to create investing portfolios.  
 
- I'm currently learning more about new quantitative trading strategies and how to implement them using Python.

- I'm aiming to build a coding portfolio that would serve as my knowledge  collection hub 
  and would hopefully help other people as I truly believe in the importance of open-source and reproducible research.

- Fun fact: I speak 3 languages, Assyrian, Arabic, and English + I play League of Legends & Age of Empires ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ.
